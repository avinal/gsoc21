Updates
-------

In the first phase of GSoC 2021 @ The FOSSology Project, I have completed the desired milestone. As of now, FOSSology can be installed completely via CMake and most of the components are working fine in initial testing.

List of tasks completed

- Added CMake build configurations for all the C/C++ agents for executables, libraries, and coverages
- Added CMake install configuration for all C/C++ and PHP agents as well as extra components
- Reworked the shell scripts and generated source files to make them more compatible with CMake as well as better in terms of overall compatibility with the latest tools.

Improvements
------------

- The new CMake build architecture is much more flexible to changes as compared to hard-coded Makefiles.
- CMake generated configurations support parallel build by default, this has led to significant improvement in build time. CMake generated configuration can now build the whole project within 2 mins or even faster on more powerful CPUs (Both Ninja and Makefiles with the same number of parallel processes) compared to 4-5 minutes previously. *(These results are averaged from initial testing of new build architecture)*
- CMake supports out-source builds by default, which means the source folders are not touched/modified while building, all build files and residuals get their separate folder and the source tree can be cleaned easily. 
- Developers can now opt for a long list of generators to build FOSSology e.g Makefiles, Ninja as per their needs.
  
How to test
-----------

Instructions to test the new Build system is in `this <https://github.com/avinal/fossology/wiki#test-the-new-system-only-gcc-with-make-and-ninja-tested-for-now>`_ wiki. 

Known Issues
------------

- There may be a permission issue with some generated sources while building. This can be bypassed for now by running :code:`sudo chmod +x <filename>` command.
- Coverage builds may fail.

Postponed Tasks
-----------------------

- configuration for tests are skipped for now

Work in Progress
----------------

- Currently, I am working on packaging the FOSSology with CMake.
